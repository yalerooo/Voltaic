//! Kubernetes panel: clusters, pods, services, deployments, logs, integrated terminal.
//!
//! **Roadmap phase:** 4. **Planned backend:** `kube / k8s-openapi`.
//!
//! This crate is scaffolded as an independent module. The public surface
//! ([`KubeClient`] + [`KubernetesConfig`]) is
//! defined now so the Tauri layer and command schema can be wired ahead of the
//! full implementation, which lands in its roadmap phase.
