//! Docker panel: containers, images, networks, volumes, logs, exec.
//!
//! **Roadmap phase:** 4. **Planned backend:** `bollard`.
//!
//! This crate is scaffolded as an independent module. The public surface
//! ([`DockerClient`] + [`DockerConfig`]) is
//! defined now so the Tauri layer and command schema can be wired ahead of the
//! full implementation, which lands in its roadmap phase.
