//! # voltaic-workspace

//! Workspace system: group servers/tabs, save and restore session layouts.
//!
//! **Roadmap phase:** 1. **Planned backend:** `(core only)`.
//!
//! This crate is scaffolded as an independent module. The public surface
//! ([`WorkspaceManager`] + [`WorkspaceConfig`]) is
//! defined now so the Tauri layer and command schema can be wired ahead of the
//! full implementation, which lands in its roadmap phase.
