//! # voltaic-ai

//! AI assistant: provider-agnostic (OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, Gemini, OpenRouter).
//!
//! **Roadmap phase:** 5. **Planned backend:** `reqwest`.
//!
//! This crate is scaffolded as an independent module. The public surface
//! ([`AiProvider`] + [`AiConfig`]) is
//! defined now so the Tauri layer and command schema can be wired ahead of the
//! full implementation, which lands in its roadmap phase.
